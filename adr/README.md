# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Easel CLI project. ADRs document significant architectural decisions, their context, and rationale to help current and future developers understand why certain choices were made.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the project, along with their context and consequences. They help teams:

- Document the reasoning behind architectural choices
- Provide context for future developers
- Track the evolution of architectural decisions
- Enable informed decision-making when revisiting past choices

## ADR Format

All ADRs in this project follow a consistent format based on the template in [`adr-template.md`](adr-template.md). Each ADR includes:

- **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- **Context**: The problem being addressed and constraints
- **Decision Drivers**: Factors that influenced the decision
- **Considered Options**: Alternative approaches that were evaluated
- **Decision Outcome**: The chosen solution and rationale
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative impacts of the decision

## Current ADRs

### Core Architecture Decisions

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [001](adr-001-cli-framework-selection.md) | CLI Framework Selection | Accepted | 2025-07-31 |
| [002](adr-002-http-client-selection.md) | HTTP Client Selection | Accepted | 2025-07-31 |
| [003](adr-003-configuration-management.md) | Configuration Management Approach | Accepted | 2025-07-31 |
| [004](adr-004-output-formatting-architecture.md) | Output Formatting Architecture | Accepted | 2025-07-31 |
| [005](adr-005-authentication-strategy.md) | Authentication Strategy | Accepted | 2025-07-31 |

### Decision Summary

The core architectural decisions establish Easel CLI as a modern, secure, and extensible tool:

- **Click Framework**: Provides excellent CLI structure and user experience
- **httpx HTTP Client**: Enables async operations and modern HTTP features
- **YAML Configuration**: Balances human readability with structured validation
- **Rich-based Formatting**: Delivers professional output with plugin extensibility
- **Personal Access Token Auth**: Ensures reliable Canvas integration with future OAuth2 support

## Adding New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. **Copy the template**: Use [`adr-template.md`](adr-template.md) as starting point
2. **Number sequentially**: Use the next available number (e.g., `adr-006-...`)
3. **Follow naming convention**: `adr-XXX-brief-title.md`
4. **Include implementation details**: Provide concrete examples where helpful
5. **Update this index**: Add the new ADR to the table above

### When to Write an ADR

Consider writing an ADR for decisions that:

- Affect the overall system architecture
- Have long-term consequences or are difficult to reverse
- Involve trade-offs between multiple viable options
- Impact multiple team members or future developers
- Establish patterns or conventions for the project

### When NOT to Write an ADR

ADRs are not needed for:

- Routine implementation decisions
- Temporary or easily reversible choices
- Decisions with only one viable option
- Pure implementation details without architectural impact

## Decision Categories

Our ADRs cover several key architectural areas:

### User Interface & Experience
- **CLI Framework** (ADR-001): How users interact with Easel
- **Output Formatting** (ADR-004): How data is presented to users

### External Integration
- **HTTP Client** (ADR-002): How Easel communicates with Canvas
- **Authentication** (ADR-005): How Easel securely accesses Canvas APIs

### Internal Architecture
- **Configuration** (ADR-003): How Easel manages settings and credentials

## Evolution and Superseding

As the project evolves, some decisions may need to be reconsidered:

- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR
- **Accepted**: Decision is current and actively followed

When superseding an ADR:

1. Create a new ADR documenting the new decision
2. Update the old ADR's status to "Superseded by ADR-XXX"
3. Link between the old and new ADRs
4. Update this index to reflect the changes

## Questions or Suggestions?

If you have questions about any architectural decisions or suggestions for new ADRs, please:

- Open a GitHub issue for discussion
- Propose changes via pull request
- Discuss in team meetings or architecture reviews

Remember: ADRs are living documents that serve the team. They should be updated when our understanding evolves or when decisions prove inadequate for new requirements.
