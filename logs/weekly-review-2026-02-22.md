# Weekly review: easel

**Period:** 2026-02-16 to 2026-02-22

## Accomplished

- **Full greenfield buildout (Phases 0-5):** Took easel from init commit
  to a working Canvas LMS CLI in a single day (18 commits on 2026-02-22).
  Core layer (config, async HTTP client, course cache), courses, assignments,
  rubrics, grading, assessment workflow, modules, pages, and discussions
  are all implemented with services, CLI sub-apps, and tests.

- **Core infrastructure:** Async httpx client with pagination and 429 retry,
  pydantic-settings config, bidirectional course code/ID cache, Typer CLI
  with global options (--format, --test, --config), async bridge decorator.

- **Assessment workflow:** Full pipeline -- fetch assignment+rubric, pull
  submissions, build/load/save/update assessment JSON, stats, and submit
  approved grades to Canvas. Bracket-notation rubric form data handled
  correctly.

- **Skill commands migration:** assess/* skill commands (setup, ai-pass,
  refine, submit) migrated from canvas-mcp to easel CLI. Added
  `easel commands install` to copy skill files into project `.claude/commands/`.

- **Configuration refactor:** Env vars settled on `CANVAS_API_KEY` and
  `CANVAS_BASE_URL` after two rounds of renaming (CANVAS_API_TOKEN/URL ->
  CANVAS_API_KEY/BASE_URL).

- **Test suite:** 210 tests passing across core, services, and CLI layers.
  All tests mock at appropriate boundaries (transport-level for client,
  CanvasClient-level for services, service-level for CLI). Ruff clean.

## In progress

- **Phase 6 (polish):** ~40% complete. `commands install` CLI done, skill
  commands migrated. Remaining: live smoke tests, `easel config` sub-app,
  shell completion, README, documentation pass.

## Stalled or blocked

- Nothing stalled. The project is a single-day buildout with no stale
  branches or forgotten work items.

## Recommended next steps

1. Run live smoke tests against Canvas API for all commands before adding
   more features -- confirm real-world behavior matches test expectations.
2. Implement `easel config` sub-app (init/global/show) for repo-level
   course_parameters.yaml setup.
3. Add shell completion support (Typer has built-in support for this).
4. Write the README with "Extending with AI" section covering skills and
   the assess/* pipeline.
5. Tag 0.1.0 once smoke tests pass and docs are in place.
