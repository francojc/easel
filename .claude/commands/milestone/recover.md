# Milestone Development Recovery

You are executing recovery protocols for milestone development failures. The phase argument should be one of: setup, analyze, implement, validate, integrate, submit.

## Recovery Protocol for Phase: $ARGUMENTS

### Common Failure Scenarios

#### 1. Identify Failure Context

!echo "=== RECOVERY ANALYSIS FOR PHASE: $ARGUMENTS ==="
!echo "Current branch: $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
!echo "Git status:"
!git status --porcelain
!echo ""
!echo "Recent commits:"
!git log --oneline -3

### Phase-Specific Recovery Procedures

#### Setup Phase Recovery

!if [ "$ARGUMENTS" = "setup" ]; then
  echo "=== SETUP PHASE RECOVERY ==="
  
  echo "1. Checking Python environment..."
  python --version || echo "‚ùå Python installation issue"
  
  echo "2. Checking Poetry installation..."
  poetry --version || echo "‚ùå Poetry installation issue - run: curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -"
  
  echo "3. Reinstalling dependencies..."
  poetry install --with dev || echo "‚ùå Dependency installation failed"
  
  echo "4. Reinitializing pre-commit..."
  poetry run pre-commit install || echo "‚ùå Pre-commit setup failed"
  
  echo "Setup recovery complete. Re-run /milestone:setup to verify."
fi

!echo ""
!echo "=== EMERGENCY RECOVERY OPTIONS ==="
!echo "If recovery fails, consider these options:"

!echo "   git stash"
!echo "   git clean -fd"

!echo ""
!echo "üö® Nuclear Reset (start milestone over):"
!echo "   git checkout main"

!echo "   /milestone:analyze <milestone-number>"

### Escalation Protocol

#### 4. When to Escalate

!echo ""
!echo "=== ESCALATION PROTOCOL ==="
!echo "Escalate to human review if:"
!echo "- 3+ recovery attempts have failed"
!echo "- Security vulnerabilities detected"
!echo "- Architectural decisions needed"
!echo "- External dependencies broken"
!echo ""
!echo "To escalate:"
!echo "1. Document the specific failure in detail"
!echo "2. Create draft PR with current progress"
!echo "3. Add comment requesting human review"
!echo "4. Tag issue with 'needs-review' label"

### Recovery Success Validation

#### 5. Verify Recovery

!echo ""
!echo "=== RECOVERY VALIDATION ==="
!echo "After recovery, verify with:"
!echo "- /milestone:doctor (health check)"
!echo "- Re-run the failed phase command"
!echo "- Check all quality gates pass"

!echo ""
!echo "Recovery analysis complete for phase: $ARGUMENTS"
!echo "Review the guidance above and take appropriate action."
