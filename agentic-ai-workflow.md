# Agentic AI Workflow Implementation Guide

**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Guide for implementing agentic AI development workflows  
**Target:** Development teams using Claude Code and similar AI agents  

## Overview

This document outlines best practices for implementing agentic AI workflows in software development, specifically for the Easel CLI project. It provides guidance on when to use AI agents, how to set up successful workflows, and how to maintain quality and security standards.

## When to Use Agentic AI

### Ideal Use Cases
- **Well-defined, structured tasks** with clear acceptance criteria
- **Repetitive implementation patterns** following established conventions
- **Boilerplate generation** for consistent project structures
- **Test scaffolding** and coverage improvement
- **Documentation generation** following established formats
- **Code refactoring** within well-understood boundaries

### Avoid for These Tasks
- **Architectural decision making** requiring domain expertise
- **Security-critical implementations** without human validation
- **Complex business logic** with ambiguous requirements
- **Integration with external systems** lacking clear documentation
- **Performance optimization** requiring deep system understanding

## Claude Code Specific Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering for Claude Code

#### 1. Context Loading Strategy
```markdown
# Always provide comprehensive context
Read these files to understand the project:
- easel-spec.md (overall architecture)
- specs/[current-milestone].md (specific requirements)
- adr/*.md (architectural decisions)
- existing code in easel/ directory (patterns to follow)
```

#### 2. Explicit Constraint Definition
```markdown
# Be specific about constraints
CONSTRAINTS:
- MUST follow existing code patterns exactly
- MUST achieve >80% test coverage
- MUST pass all quality checks (black, flake8, mypy)
- MUST NOT introduce security vulnerabilities
- MUST document all public APIs
```

#### 3. Incremental Validation Points
```markdown
# Build in validation checkpoints
After implementing each component:
1. Run tests and verify coverage
2. Run quality checks
3. Test integration with existing code
4. Validate against acceptance criteria
```

### Tool Usage Optimization

#### File System Operations
```bash
# Batch file operations for efficiency
# Good: Read multiple related files together
Read project-wide patterns before starting implementation

# Bad: Read files one at a time as needed
Don't scatter file reads throughout development
```

#### Testing Strategy
```bash
# Run tests incrementally during development
poetry run pytest --cov=easel --cov-report=term-missing tests/test_new_module.py

# Don't wait until the end to test everything
```

#### Git Operations
```bash
# Commit frequently with meaningful messages
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: implement [specific component]

- Add [specific functionality]
- Include tests with [X]% coverage
- Follow [specific ADR] pattern"
```

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Analysis & Setup

#### Environment Preparation
```bash
# Verify all tools are available and configured
which python poetry git gh
poetry --version
python --version
gh auth status

# Setup development environment
poetry install --with dev
poetry shell
pre-commit install
```

#### Context Analysis
1. **Read specifications thoroughly**
   - Main project spec
   - Specific milestone requirements
   - All relevant ADRs
   - Existing code patterns

2. **Identify dependencies and constraints**
   - Required libraries and versions
   - Integration points with existing code
   - Testing requirements
   - Documentation standards

3. **Plan implementation approach**
   - Break down tasks into manageable chunks
   - Identify validation checkpoints
   - Plan testing strategy

### Phase 2: Iterative Development

#### Development Loop
```bash
# 1. Implement small component
# 2. Write tests immediately
# 3. Run validation
poetry run pytest --cov=easel --cov-report=term-missing
poetry run black easel/ tests/
poetry run flake8 easel/ tests/
poetry run mypy easel/

# 4. Commit if validation passes
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: implement [component]"

# 5. Repeat for next component
```

#### Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage:** Must meet project threshold (80% or 95%)
- **Type Checking:** Must pass mypy without errors
- **Code Style:** Must pass black and flake8
- **Integration:** Must work with existing codebase
- **Documentation:** Must document public APIs

### Phase 3: Integration & Validation

#### End-to-End Testing
```bash
# Test complete workflows
easel init  # If configuration features added
easel doctor  # Validation commands
easel [new-commands] --help  # CLI integration
```

#### Acceptance Criteria Validation
- Systematically test each acceptance criterion
- Document validation results
- Fix any failures before proceeding
- Re-test after fixes

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Automated Quality Checks

#### Pre-commit Hooks Configuration
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 23.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
        language_version: python3.8
  
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 6.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
  
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
    rev: v1.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: mypy
        additional_dependencies: [types-PyYAML, types-requests]
```

#### Coverage Requirements
```bash
# Coverage configuration in pyproject.toml
[tool.coverage.run]
source = ["easel"]
omit = ["*/tests/*", "*/test_*"]

[tool.coverage.report]
fail_under = 80  # 95 for production milestones
show_missing = true
skip_covered = false
```

### Security Best Practices

#### Sensitive Data Handling
```python
# Good: Use environment variables for secrets
import os
api_token = os.getenv("CANVAS_API_TOKEN")

# Bad: Hardcode or log sensitive data
api_token = "your-token-here"  # Never do this
logger.info(f"Using token: {api_token}")  # Never do this
```

#### Input Validation
```python
# Always validate and sanitize inputs
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class CourseConfig(BaseModel):
    course_id: int
    
    @validator('course_id')
    def validate_course_id(cls, v):
        if v <= 0:
            raise ValueError('Course ID must be positive')
        return v
```

## Risk Management

### Common Failure Modes

#### 1. Scope Creep
**Problem:** AI agent adds features not in specification  
**Solution:** Explicit constraint definition and acceptance criteria validation

#### 2. Pattern Deviation
**Problem:** AI generates code that doesn't follow project conventions  
**Solution:** Comprehensive pattern examples and validation checkpoints

#### 3. Inadequate Testing
**Problem:** Tests don't cover edge cases or achieve coverage targets  
**Solution:** Coverage thresholds and incremental testing requirements

#### 4. Security Vulnerabilities
**Problem:** AI introduces security issues through poor practices  
**Solution:** Security-focused validation and human review for sensitive code

### Mitigation Strategies

#### Checkpoint Validation
```bash
# After each major component
./scripts/validate-checkpoint.sh

# Contents of validation script:
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Running quality checks..."
poetry run pytest --cov=easel --cov-report=term-missing
poetry run black --check easel/ tests/
poetry run flake8 easel/ tests/
poetry run mypy easel/

echo "Checking security..."
poetry run bandit -r easel/

echo "Validating documentation..."
poetry run pydocstyle easel/

echo "All checks passed!"
```

#### Human Review Triggers
- Security-sensitive implementations
- Complex business logic
- Performance-critical code
- Integration with external systems
- Architectural changes

## Best Practices for Different Agent Types

### Claude Code Specific

#### Effective Prompting
```markdown
# Structure prompts for Claude Code:
1. Clear mission statement
2. Complete context provision
3. Explicit constraints and requirements
4. Step-by-step workflow
5. Validation checkpoints
6. Error handling protocols
```

#### Tool Usage Patterns
```markdown
# Efficient tool usage:
- Batch file reads at the beginning
- Use glob patterns for file discovery
- Leverage bash for complex operations
- Use grep for code pattern analysis
- Edit files incrementally, not wholesale replacement
```

#### Memory Management
```markdown
# For large codebases:
- Focus on relevant files only
- Use code search to understand patterns
- Reference architecture decisions frequently
- Break complex tasks into smaller chunks
```

### General AI Agent Considerations

#### Context Window Management
- Load critical context first
- Reference key constraints throughout
- Use external memory (files) for complex state
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces

#### Error Recovery
- Implement checkpoint saves
- Plan rollback strategies
- Document assumptions and decisions
- Create clear escalation paths

## Monitoring & Evaluation

### Success Metrics

#### Quantitative Measures
- **Code Quality:** Coverage, lint scores, type checking pass rate
- **Functionality:** Acceptance criteria pass rate, integration test success
- **Performance:** Implementation time, review cycle time
- **Reliability:** Bug rate, rework percentage

#### Qualitative Measures
- **Code Maintainability:** Follows project patterns, well-documented
- **User Experience:** Consistent with project standards
- **Team Integration:** Minimal review overhead, clean PR integration

### Continuous Improvement

#### Feedback Loops
```bash
# After each milestone, evaluate:
# 1. What worked well?
# 2. What required human intervention?
# 3. What patterns should be documented?
# 4. What constraints should be added?

# Document lessons learned in project wiki
# Update agent prompts based on experience
# Refine quality gates based on failure modes
```

#### Prompt Evolution
- Version control your agent prompts
- A/B test different prompt strategies
- Collect metrics on prompt effectiveness
- Iterate based on outcomes

## Conclusion

Agentic AI workflows can significantly accelerate development when implemented thoughtfully. Success depends on:

1. **Clear specifications** and well-defined acceptance criteria
2. **Robust quality gates** and validation checkpoints
3. **Comprehensive context** and constraint definition
4. **Incremental validation** and course correction
5. **Security-first approach** with human oversight for sensitive areas

The key is to leverage AI's strengths (consistency, pattern following, comprehensive implementation) while mitigating its weaknesses (creativity constraints, context limitations, security blind spots) through proper workflow design and validation protocols.

For the Easel CLI project specifically, this approach should accelerate milestone delivery while maintaining the high standards required for educational technology infrastructure.
