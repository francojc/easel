        self.config = config

    async def stream_grades(self, course_id: int) -> AsyncIterator[GradeRecord]:
        """Stream grades without loading all into memory"""
        async for assignment in self.client.get_assignments(course_id):
            async for submission in self.client.get_submissions(assignment.id):
                yield GradeRecord.from_submission(submission)

    def export_to_csv(self, records: AsyncIterator[GradeRecord], output_path: Path):
        """Export with progress tracking and memory efficiency"""
        with open(output_path, 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8-sig') as f:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=self.get_headers())
            writer.writeheader()

            with progress_bar() as progress:
                async for record in records:
                    writer.writerow(record.to_dict())
                    progress.update()
```
