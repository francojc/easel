## Overview

This document outlines the complete development roadmap for Easel CLI, broken down into six distinct milestones. Each milestone represents a complete development cycle with specific deliverables, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.

## Milestone Summary

| Milestone | Goal | Duration | Priority | Status |
|-----------|------|----------|----------|---------|
| [01-core-infrastructure](01-core-infrastructure.md) | Establish foundational architecture and tooling | 2-3 weeks | Critical | Complete |
| [02-read-only-commands](02-read-only-commands.md) | Implement core read-only Canvas operations | 3-4 weeks | High | Complete |
| [03-data-export-analytics](03-data-export-analytics.md) | Add data export and analytics capabilities | 2-3 weeks | High | Planned |
| [04-automation-features](04-automation-features.md) | Enable automation and scripting integration | 2 weeks | Medium | Planned |
| [05-production-readiness](05-production-readiness.md) | Achieve enterprise-grade reliability | 3-4 weeks | Critical | Planned |
| [06-distribution](06-distribution.md) | Enable easy installation and deployment | 2-3 weeks | High | Planned |

**Total Estimated Duration:** 14-19 weeks

## Development Approach

### GitHub Workflow Integration

Each milestone document is designed to integrate seamlessly with GitHub's project management features:

1. **Issues Creation:** Each task in the detailed breakdown can become a GitHub Issue
2. **Milestone Tracking:** GitHub Milestones correspond directly to our milestone documents
3. **Pull Request Workflow:** Features developed in branches, reviewed via PRs
4. **Progress Tracking:** Issue completion tracked against milestone acceptance criteria

### Task Granularity

Tasks are written at the right level of granularity for development teams:

- **Actionable:** Each task can be assigned to a developer
- **Testable:** Clear completion criteria for each task
- **Estimable:** Tasks sized appropriately for sprint planning
- **Independent:** Minimal dependencies between tasks within milestones

### Quality Gates

Each milestone includes comprehensive quality requirements:

- **Test Coverage:** Minimum 80% (95% for production milestone)
- **Documentation:** All public APIs and user features documented
- **Performance:** Specific performance targets and benchmarks
- **Security:** Security reviews and vulnerability scanning

## Risk Management

### Cross-Milestone Dependencies

- **Milestone 1** is foundational - delays impact all subsequent milestones
- **Milestone 5** (Production Readiness) is critical for enterprise adoption
- **Milestone 6** (Distribution) enables user adoption and feedback

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Parallel Development:** Some tasks can be developed in parallel after Milestone 1
2. **Early Integration:** Continuous integration prevents late-stage integration issues
3. **Incremental Delivery:** Each milestone delivers working functionality
4. **Fallback Plans:** Core functionality prioritized over advanced features

## Success Metrics

### Technical Quality

- **Code Coverage:** >95% by final milestone
- **Performance:** <2s response for uncached operations, <100ms for cached
- **Reliability:** >99.9% uptime in production environments
- **Security:** Zero high/critical vulnerabilities

### User Experience

- **Time to First Success:** <5 minutes from installation to first command
- **Documentation Quality:** Self-service onboarding capability
- **Error Handling:** Actionable error messages with clear next steps
- **Platform Support:** Works reliably across Linux, macOS, and Windows

### Business Value

- **Automation Capability:** Enables automated Canvas workflows
- **Data Accessibility:** Provides programmatic access to Canvas data
- **Institutional Adoption:** Suitable for enterprise deployment
- **Community Growth:** Extensible architecture for community contributions

## Resource Planning

### Skill Requirements

- **Python Development:** Advanced knowledge of Python ecosystem
- **API Integration:** Experience with REST APIs and authentication
- **CLI Development:** Understanding of command-line interface design
- **Testing:** Comprehensive testing strategies and frameworks
- **DevOps:** CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation

### Timeline Considerations

- **Learning Curve:** Canvas API familiarization time
- **Testing:** Comprehensive testing with real Canvas instances
- **Documentation:** User and developer documentation creation
- **Feedback Integration:** User feedback and iteration cycles

## Getting Started

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Repository Setup:** Initialize repository with Milestone 1 structure
2. **Team Formation:** Assign developers to milestone tasks
3. **Environment Setup:** Establish development and testing environments
4. **Canvas Access:** Secure Canvas API access for development and testing

### First Sprint Planning

Focus on Milestone 1 core infrastructure tasks:

- Project scaffolding and dependency management
- Basic CLI framework implementation
- Configuration management system
- Canvas API client foundation

### Communication Plan

- **Weekly Reviews:** Progress against milestone acceptance criteria
- **Milestone Demos:** Working functionality demonstration at milestone completion
- **Stakeholder Updates:** Regular communication with institutional stakeholders
- **Documentation Updates:** Living documentation updated throughout development

## Future Enhancements

Beyond the core six milestones, potential future enhancements include:

- **Write Operations:** Assignment creation, grade upload, enrollment management
- **Advanced Analytics:** Machine learning insights and predictions
- **Real-time Integration:** Webhook support and real-time data synchronization
- **Multi-Institution Support:** Enhanced support for multiple Canvas instances
- **GraphQL Support:** Next-generation API integration when available
