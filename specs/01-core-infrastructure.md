# Milestone 1: Core Infrastructure

**Goal:** Establish the foundational architecture and tooling for the Easel CLI

**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**Priority:** Critical
**Dependencies:** None

## Overview

This milestone establishes the core infrastructure necessary for all future development. It focuses on project setup, authentication, configuration management, and basic Canvas API connectivity.

## Deliverables

- Project scaffolding with Poetry dependency management
- Click-based command framework with extensible structure
- Configuration management system with validation
- Canvas API client with rate limiting and error handling
- Basic authentication flow for Canvas API tokens
- Configuration validation command (`easel doctor`)

## Acceptance Criteria

- `easel init` command launches an interactive configuration wizard
- API client properly handles Canvas rate limits and pagination
- Configuration system stores credentials for a single institution securely
- All core components have unit tests with >80% coverage
- Project follows Python packaging best practices

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### Project Setup & Scaffolding

- [ ] Initialize Poetry project with proper metadata and dependencies
- [ ] Set up project directory structure (`easel/cli/`, `easel/api/`, etc.)
- [ ] Configure pytest with coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality (black, flake8, mypy)
- [ ] Create initial GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- [ ] Add basic .gitignore and README.md

### Command Framework

- [ ] Implement base Click command structure with proper entry points
- [ ] Create command group hierarchy (course, assignment, user, config)
- [ ] Implement global options (`--config`, `--format`, `--verbose`)
- [ ] Add command discovery and plugin architecture foundation
- [ ] Create help system with consistent formatting
- [ ] Implement version command with build information

### Configuration Management

- [ ] Design configuration schema with YAML validation
- [ ] Implement configuration file discovery (`~/.easel/` or `~/.config/easel/`)
- [ ] Create `easel init` interactive setup wizard
- [ ] Add configuration validation with clear error messages
- [ ] Implement `easel config list` command to display current settings
- [ ] Add support for environment variable overrides

### Canvas API Client

- [ ] Create httpx-based API client with async support
- [ ] Implement Canvas API authentication with token management
- [ ] Add rate limiting with configurable limits and backoff
- [ ] Create pagination handler for Canvas API responses
- [ ] Implement request/response logging with configurable levels
- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff for network errors

### Validation & Diagnostics

- [ ] Implement `easel doctor` command for configuration validation
- [ ] Add Canvas API connectivity testing
- [ ] Create token validation against Canvas API
- [ ] Add network connectivity checks with meaningful error messages
- [ ] Implement configuration file permissions validation
- [ ] Add dependency version compatibility checks

### Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Set up pytest fixtures for API client testing
- [ ] Create mock Canvas API responses using respx
- [ ] Add integration tests for configuration management
- [ ] Create test utilities for command testing with Click
- [ ] Set up test data fixtures for Canvas API responses
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking for API client operations

### Documentation

- [ ] Create architectural decision records (ADRs) for key decisions
- [ ] Document API client usage patterns for other developers
- [ ] Add configuration file format documentation
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common setup issues
- [ ] Document plugin architecture for future extensions

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"
click = "^8.1.0"
httpx = "^0.24.0"
rich = "^13.0.0"
pyyaml = "^6.0"
pydantic = "^2.0.0"

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pytest = "^7.0.0"
pytest-cov = "^4.0.0"
pytest-asyncio = "^0.21.0"
respx = "^0.20.0"
black = "^23.0.0"
flake8 = "^6.0.0"
mypy = "^1.0.0"
```

### Configuration Schema

```yaml
# ~/.easel/config.yaml
institution:
  name: "University Name"
  canvas_url: "https://university.instructure.com"
  api_token: "encrypted_token_here"

api:
  rate_limit: 10  # requests per second
  timeout: 30     # seconds
  retries: 3

cache:
  enabled: true
  ttl: 300       # seconds

logging:
  level: "INFO"
  file: "~/.easel/logs/easel.log"
```

### Command Structure

```bash
easel init                    # Interactive setup wizard
easel doctor                  # Validate configuration and connectivity
easel config list             # Display current configuration
easel --version              # Show version information
easel --help                 # Display help
```

## Success Metrics

- All commands execute without errors in a clean environment
- API client successfully connects to Canvas test instance
- Configuration wizard completes end-to-end setup
- Test suite runs with >80% coverage
- Documentation covers all public APIs

## Risk Mitigation

- **Canvas API changes:** Pin to specific API version (v1)
- **Authentication issues:** Provide clear token setup instructions
- **Configuration complexity:** Keep initial setup minimal but extensible
- **Dependency conflicts:** Use Poetry lock file for reproducible builds

## Follow-up Tasks

Items that will be addressed in subsequent milestones:

- Output formatting system (Milestone 2)
- Caching layer implementation (Milestone 5)
- Shell completion scripts (Milestone 6)
- OAuth2 authentication support (Future enhancement)
